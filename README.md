#### Q: Why should I use a README.md for my projects?
A: README.md help developers understand the purpose and functionality of your project as well as give place for communication for usage and collaboration on your applications.
#### Q: Can I adjust my new readme file once it is generated?
A: Of course! This application is designed to help developers create a simple README.md from a preset template, but once you have the file, you are free to add/remove as you please.
